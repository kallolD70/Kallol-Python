#variable is a name given to the memory slot
name = "Kallol Das" # (variable = value)
age = 21
price = 25.99 

#we have to use double course in a String 

print(name)
print(age)
print(price)

print("My name is :",name)
print("My age is :", age)

a = 5
#in math this means a=5
# but in programming the value of the variable,a is 5
#in math a=b means a and b are equal 
#in programming the value of the variable a is b
# if we want to check equal then we have to use (==)
#its called The Assignment rule
# = is the Assignment operator

#we can use underscore is Variable "_"
#we cant use !@#$%^&* as identifier / Variable
#A digit cant come in first (1name -> NOT OK)/(name1 -> OK)

#We can denote multiple variable together by using Comma ","
A , B = 5 , 6
