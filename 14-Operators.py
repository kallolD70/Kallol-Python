# Types of operators
# Arithmetic Operator(+ - * / % **)

a = 5
b = 2
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)# division will always bring a output as a float 
print(a%b)# Modulo Operator used to calculate Remainder
print(a ** b)# a^b


# Relational / Comparison Operators (== != < > <= >=)
a = 50
b = 20
print(a == b) #False
print(a != b) #True
print(a >= b) #True
print(a > b) #True
print(a <= b) #True
print(a > b) #True
