#Loop
#Loops are used to repeat instruction
#there are two type of loops
# "for" & "while"

#While loop ->
"""
while (condition) :
    work
    incriment(It wil be inside the loop)
"""

"""
while True:
    print("Kallol Das Kushol")
#Its a infinite loop because the condition is given True
iteratior(i) is the variable given on the loop
iteration means the loop running a time
"""

#now the value of i = 6 thats why the loop has stoped
#so if we print i then the value of i will be 6
